# Sample fun utility which can help you send a message to a recipient on slack at your own convenient time(same day) without you have to open and draft the message. You should also pass your "status" info(Show as Active/Show as Away) to this utility.
## Assumes that your laptop is running and internet connection is ON and slack is installed.
## Check out the show_help() command for more details on how to run the actual command to send message
## Also includes a helper bash script which helps to set up all necessary environments/packages etc. for this program to run. Just make sure to give execute permissions to the bash script.
## Have fun!! Enjoy!!
